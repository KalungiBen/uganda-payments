# üá∫üá¨ Uganda Payments

Community-driven approach to payment gateways and integrations in Uganda!

## Why We Made This?

If you've been around our developer communities for a while, I'm sure you're tired of the following questions that keep coming up over and over:

- What are the available payment gateways in Uganda?
- What are the best payment gateways in Uganda?
- How do you add payments to a website or mobile app?
- Why do current payment solutions suck?

No single individual knows all the answers, but as a community and developer ecosystem, we can collect shared knowledge. This is our humble attempt towards that. Contribute to the way we make this better for everyone else!
